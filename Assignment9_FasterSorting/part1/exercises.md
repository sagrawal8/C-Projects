# Exercises

1. Explain: What do you think the Big-O (worst-case) complexity of the merge sort algorithm is and why? 

O(nlogn); n levels to split and logn sub arrays that are the product of splitting.

2. Explain: What do you think the best-case complexity of the merge sort algorithm is and why?
Big Omega (nlogn) as Big Omega(nlogn) < Big O(nlogn). Best case is if the array is already sorted. Then merge(arr, l, m, r) doesnt need to compare the values.

3. Does merge sort require any additional storage beyond the original array? If so how much and why?

Yes, it requires 2 temp arrays for the left and right sides. Both arrays together have a size equal to the original array.

4. How much time in Big-O does it take to merge all of the subarrays together? Explain or draw why?

  O(n * l * r). 
  The merging subarray steps iterates through the entire left and right arrays and does so for each level for splitting.

## Interview Prep (Optional +1% Bonus on assignment)

A bit ago a student asked me about this course, CS 5800, and other courses and how they may prepare you for interviews. I was recently talking to a Google, now Microsoft Engineer who told me that the reality is having a lot of LeetCode practice will help. LeetCode is a website to practice solving algorithmic challenges.

Let's finish off this exercise with a small C programming sample.

###

Solve the following: https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/

**Copy and paste your code into** a file in this directory called [challenge.c](./challenge.c) that solves the following problem.

**Given:** Two sorted integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array and return the sorted array as a new array.

The number of elements initialized in `nums1` and `nums2` are *m* and *n* respectively.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
```

Constraints:

```
nums1.length == m + n
nums2.length == n
0 <= m, n <= 200
1 <= m + n <= 200
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 109
```
